### Project description
This Django-project is a weather app where a user can enter a city. When the user clicks on the button 'Verzend naar DB', an API is called to retrieve actual weather data for this city. From this data, the temperature and some other information is collected and this data is stored in a MySQL database. The user can view all stored city 'weather-timestamps' in the webapp.
